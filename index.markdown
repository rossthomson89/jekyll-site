I'm a Web Developer from Aberdeen specialising in all things Frontend. Frontend development is where my main strengths are but you could say I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 8+ years in the creative industry.

I started my career building cross-platform mobile apps and transitioned over to Full Stack Web Development. Currently, I spend most of my time building fully customised CMS's, online stores, landing pages as well as some other cool stuff.

Currently working for the amazingly talented team at <a href="https://fortytwo.studio">FortyTwo Studio</a>. When I'm not working I listen to music (Like ALOT). Check out my weekly updated <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ross_182/playlist/5kNNTTP9FJ9de376BOnkr5?si=5Oco2FYnQVOi_Oi09liCMg">Spotify Playlist</a> of stuff I'm listening to.
