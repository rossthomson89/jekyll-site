Well if you're reading this you already know this has been launched huh? It's been a project years in the making and took several tries and re-starts before I settled on one criteria - cost. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a solution I'd recommend to most of my clients (or anyone who isn't a dev for that matter) but I run this site for around Â£40 per year. This price is the yearly cost for my domain rossthomson.dev. Hosting is free. CMS has no license free. Theres no database.

* Hosting: <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">Github Pages</a>
* Blog/CMS Functionality: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="blank">Jekyll</a> (which is a static site generator)
* Form Functionality: <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="blank">Formspree</a>
* Frontend/Design: Yours Truly

I'll put together a multi-part tutorial on how I implemented this site in the near future for any aspiring web developers who want a flat file site on the cheap
